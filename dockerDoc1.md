To install docker for a Debian virtual machine, follow the instructions found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/. Run sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin in order to install docker compose. Create a new directory and clone the repository for nextCloud found at https://github.com/nextcloud/docker. Navigate into the folder called '32' to use the Dockerfile for the 32nd apache version. Then run 'docker build -t mynextcloud .' to create a new container called mynextcloud. To verify this was successful, run 'docker image ls'  and find mynextcloud in the 'IMAGE' column. Next make a new directory with 'mkdir nextclouddata'  to mount the volume to. Then run 'docker run -d -v ./nextclouddata:/var/www/html mynextcloud' to run the mynextcloud container with the Dockerfile's volume '/var/www/html' mounted to the local directory that was just made. Then, run 'docker ps' to verify the mynextcloud container is running and to determine information such as 'CONTAINER ID NAME' and 'PORTS'. Then, run 'sudo docker logs [CONTAINER ID NAME]' to find the IP address. Enter the IP address into a web browser to launch the app. Here is a picture of nextCloud running:
